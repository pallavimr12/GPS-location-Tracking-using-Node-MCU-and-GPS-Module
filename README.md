# GPS-location-tracker-using-Node-MCU-and-GPS-Module
Here, The Repository document shows The Location Tracking using Node MCU and GPS module.To built this project we hhave created WEBPAGE to show the current location.Along with this we have used the BLYNK Platform to track thhe history of the object location using WiFI module .
WORKING:The GPS module starts looking for satellite as soon as device is turned on.The GPS module receives synchronized signals that identify the position and time of the satellite at any given moment after the link between the GPS module and the satellites are establised.To determine its real-time position,the GPS module evalutes the signals it receives from at least 4 satellites based on their arrival times.The codes determine the precise time where the module is travelling by synchroizing the receiver clocks with automatic clocks on the satellite.The Node MCU microcontroller receives thhe same time and date as the position and modifies the data that will be displayed on the webpage. It takes the GPS module a few seconds to obtain the coordination information.Depending on the weather where the module is located,the time varies.The object tracking system uses the firsst set of location coordinates that the GPS module receives from the satellite network and saves them.The location coordinates that the object uses to travel are stored when it begins to move from its initial place,and they are displayed on the webpages of google GPS API.The blynk application receives the same beginning position and the coordination points that the object traveled through.The tracked journey and current location are displayed by the Blynk app when it is connected to a Node MCU
